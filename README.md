# Diabetes Risk Prediction

## Problem
Early identification of individuals at risk of diabetes is critical for prevention, but models must balance predictive performance with interpretability to be useful in real-world health contexts.

## Data
Clinical and biometric dataset sourced from Kaggle (100,000 patient records), including age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.  
Target variable indicates diabetes status.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest models
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis to support interpretability

## Outcome / Insight
Achieved over 85% accuracy while identifying key health indicators influencing diabetes risk, demonstrating how model insights can support actionable, domain-relevant understanding.

## Why This Matters
This project highlights my approach to machine learning as a decision-support tool: selecting models intentionally, evaluating tradeoffs, and prioritizing interpretability when decisions affect real people.

## Notes
This project emphasizes model reasoning and interpretability over black-box optimization.
